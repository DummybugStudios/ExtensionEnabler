# Extension Enabler

Extension that manages other extensions

Let's you enable and disable extensions quickly - just search for them and hit enter to toggle them

Ctrl+L is the default keyboard shortcut to bring the popup up.  
(This can be changed in the chrome://extensions page in _Keyboard Shortcuts_)

## Installing:
* Get it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-manager/baamgahfpefickjomejmemkejkeglaek)  

Or if you wanna be fancy...

* Clone the repo
* go to url chrome://extensions
* Enable Developer mode and load this as an unpacked extension
* Profit


## TODO:
* ~~Configure keyboard shortcuts to open it? (Is that even possible)~~
* ~~Autofocus textbox~~
* Line up the delete icon (I hate css)
* Have options to separate themes extensions and apps
