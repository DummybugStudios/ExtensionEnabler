# Extension Enabler

Extension that manages other extensions

Let's you enable and disable extensions quickly - just search for them and hit enter to toggle them

## Installing:
* Clone the repo
* go to url chrome://extensions
* Enable Developer mode and load this as an unpacked extension
* Profit

## TODO:
* Configure keyboard shortcuts to open it? (Is that even possible)
* Line up the delete icon (I hate css)
* Have options to separate themes extensions and apps
* Add a screenshot to this page
